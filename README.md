## OPEN ISSUES (I stopped for time reasons)

  

- Better accessible UI (colors, fonts, no animations)

- Test the components and containers (e.g., with React Testing Library)

- Global use of colors and breakpoints

- Better linter rules

- Cleanup configs

- Complete readme

- favicon

- remove flickering font load
